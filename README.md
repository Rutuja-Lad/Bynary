I Created a Django Application for A gas utility company

Django application to provide consumer services for gas utilities. The application would allow customers to submit service requests online, track the status of their requests, and view their account information. The application would also provide customer support representatives with a tool to manage requests and provide support to customers.

Features of this Appllication -

Service requests: The application would allow customers to submit service requests online. This would include the ability to select the type of service request, provide details about the request, and attach files.

Request tracking: The application would allow customers to track the status of their service requests. This would include the ability to see the status of the request, the date and time the request was submitted, and the date and time the request was resolved.

This Application Do not Contains Suitable Frontend as it was focused on creating backend functionality.

This Application Used Sql as a database for backend. Python 3.11.0 . Django 4.2.1
